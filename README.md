# Basic Evaluator

This project is a rewrite, using C# and ANTLR, of the **Basic Evaluator** 
presented in Chapter 1 of the book **Programming Languages: An Interpreter-Based 
Approach (PLAIBA)**, by Samuel N. Kamin, originally written in ISO Pascal.

The following tools were used in the implementation:
- JetBrains Rider 2021.3.2
- .NET Core 6
- ANTLR 4.9.3
- Antlr4.Runtime.Standard 4.9.3 NuGet package
- Ubuntu Linux 21.10

The project was configured using the following libraries:
- .NET Core 6
- Antlr4.Runtime.Standard 4.9.3 NuGet package

The source code and grammar for the parser and interpreter is located in the 
**BasicEvaluatorInterpreter** project folder.  When the project is compiled from Rider, 
the output assemblies are located in the **bin/Debug/net6.0** folder of the BasicEvaluatorRepl
project.
